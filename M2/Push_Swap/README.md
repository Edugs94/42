Find below the workflow chart for my Push Swap project on 42, were a list of random numbers needs to be sorted from min to max values using 2 stacks and just some allowed movements (sa, sb, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb and rrr).
The algorithm chosen is known as "Turk", and the steps followed were on the article:

Most of the times, this algotirthm is under 5500 moves for 500 random numbers.
Hope it helps
